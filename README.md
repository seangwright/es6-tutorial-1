# ES6 Tutorial 1

A series of commits detailing features & functionality of ES6 (sometimes in comparison to ES5)

## Installation

Checkout master and step through the commits which are numbered in order and given descriptions.

1. Run `npm install` to download packages
2. Run `npm start` to start webserver on `localhost:8080`
3. Access demos at `localhost:8080/index.html` and view results in console
3. If you need to transpile to ES5 because demoed functionality is not natively supported (commits >= 5), run `node babel`
